# Add Spiking Neural Network Brain Architecture

**Change ID**: add-spiking-neural-network-brain  
**Status**: Draft  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  

## Why

The current Quantum Nematode project only supports quantum and classical neural network approaches, missing the biologically realistic spiking neural network paradigm that more accurately models how C. elegans neural circuits actually operate through temporal spike patterns and synaptic plasticity.

## What Changes

- Add SpikingBrain class implementing spiking neural network dynamics
- Extend CLI to support `--brain spiking` option
- Add spiking-specific configuration parameters to YAML schema
- Implement Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron model with STDP learning
- Create example configuration files for spiking neural networks
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Impact

- Affected specs: brain-architecture, configuration-system, cli-interface
- Affected code: brain architecture modules, CLI parsing, configuration validation
- **BREAKING**: None - purely additive change

## Background

The current Quantum Nematode project supports two main brain architectures:
1. **Quantum-based**: ModularBrain and QModularBrain using variational quantum circuits
2. **Classical-based**: MLPBrain and QMLPBrain using traditional neural networks

Spiking neural networks represent a third paradigm that more closely mimics biological neural computation through:
- **Temporal dynamics**: Information encoded in spike timing and patterns
- **Event-driven computation**: Neurons only process information when receiving spikes
- **Biological realism**: More faithful representation of how real neural networks operate
- **Energy efficiency**: Sparse activation patterns reduce computational overhead

Given that this project simulates C. elegans nematode behavior, adding an SNN brain architecture provides:
- A more biologically plausible model of neural decision-making
- Opportunity to explore temporal coding for navigation tasks
- A third computational paradigm alongside quantum and classical approaches
- Research platform for bio-inspired reinforcement learning

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- Implement a SpikingBrain class that integrates with the existing brain architecture framework
- Support both rate-coded and temporal-coded learning approaches
- Maintain compatibility with existing simulation infrastructure (environment, configuration, CLI)
- Provide comparable learning performance to existing brain architectures

### Secondary Goals
- Enable research into spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) for navigation tasks
- Support different neuron models (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, Izhikevich, etc.)
- Provide visualization tools for spike patterns and neural dynamics
- Benchmark performance against quantum and classical approaches

## Scope

### In Scope
- New SpikingBrain class implementing the ClassicalBrain protocol
- Integration with existing CLI and configuration system
- Support for policy gradient learning with spiking dynamics
- Basic neuron models (LIF) and synaptic plasticity rules
- Configuration options for network topology and learning parameters
- Unit tests and integration tests for the new architecture

### Out of Scope
- Hardware acceleration using neuromorphic chips (future enhancement)
- Complex multi-compartment neuron models
- Real-time spike train visualization (can be added later)
- Detailed comparison studies between all three architectures

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Integration**: SpikingBrain can be selected via `--brain spiking` CLI option
2. **Learning Performance**: Achieves comparable navigation performance to MLPBrain
3. **Code Quality**: Maintains project standards (type checking, testing, documentation)
4. **Configuration**: Supports YAML-based configuration like existing brain types
5. **Biological Plausibility**: Implements realistic neural dynamics and learning rules

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
- **Complexity**: Spiking dynamics may introduce computational overhead
- **Learning Stability**: Temporal dynamics can make learning less stable than rate-based approaches
- **Integration Challenges**: Ensuring compatibility with existing environment and reward systems

### Mitigation
- Start with simple LIF neuron model and basic STDP learning
- Implement robust parameter initialization and gradient clipping
- Extensive testing with existing simulation scenarios
- Clear documentation and configuration examples

## Dependencies

- **Core Framework**: Builds on existing ClassicalBrain protocol and brain architecture
- **PyTorch**: Leverage existing PyTorch infrastructure for gradient computation
- **Configuration System**: Extend existing YAML configuration framework
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Use existing pytest framework and test patterns

## Timeline

This change can be implemented incrementally:
1. **Phase 1**: Core SpikingBrain class with basic LIF neurons
2. **Phase 2**: STDP learning rule implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Configuration and CLI integration
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and performance validation

## Related Work

This change complements the existing brain architectures and may inform future work on:

- Comparative studies of learning efficiency across paradigms
- Bio-inspired quantum algorithms
- Neuromorphic computing applications
