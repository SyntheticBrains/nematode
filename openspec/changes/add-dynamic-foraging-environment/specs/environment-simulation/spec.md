#### Scenario: Single Food Gradient
- **GIVEN** a dynamic environment with one food source at position (10, 10)
- **WHEN** gradient strength is queried at position (5, 5)
- **THEN** the gradient SHALL be computed using exponential decay: `strength × exp(-distance / decay_constant)`

- **AND** a new food's gradient SHALL be added when it spawns

### Requirement: Satiety-Based Agent Lifecycle
The system SHALL track agent satiety (hunger level) that decays over time and can be replenished by consuming food, with simulation terminating when satiety reaches zero.

#### Scenario: Satiety Decay Over Time

- **AND** satiety SHALL not exceed the maximum configured value (200)

#### Scenario: Starvation Termination
- **GIVEN** an agent with satiety approaching 0
- **WHEN** satiety reaches exactly 0

#### Scenario: Agent Exclusion Zone
- **GIVEN** an agent starting at position (25, 25) with exclusion radius of 10
- **WHEN** initial food sources are placed
- **THEN** no food SHALL be placed within 10 cells (Manhattan distance) of (25, 25)
- **AND** this ensures the agent must actively search rather than spawn on food

#### Scenario: Dynamic Spawn Location Validity
- **GIVEN** an environment with existing food sources
- **WHEN** a new food needs to spawn after consumption
- **THEN** the system SHALL find a valid location respecting minimum distances
- **AND** SHALL retry up to 100 attempts to find valid placement
