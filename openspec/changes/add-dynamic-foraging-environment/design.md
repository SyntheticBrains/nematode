# Dynamic Foraging Environment Design

## Context

The Quantum Nematode simulation currently supports only single-goal navigation in fixed-size grids. This limits the complexity of behaviors that can be learned and tested. To enable more realistic foraging scenarios and prepare for future multi-objective tasks (predator avoidance, resource optimization), we need a scalable multi-food environment.

**Stakeholders:**
- Researchers using the platform for quantum machine learning experiments
- Users training agents for complex behavioral studies
- Future extensions (predator-prey dynamics, multi-agent scenarios)

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with all existing configurations and brain architectures
- Performance must remain acceptable for large environments (100×100 grids)
- Must preserve the chemotaxis-based navigation mechanism central to C. elegans biology
- Configuration system must remain simple and intuitive

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
1. Enable persistent multi-food foraging environments with configurable scale
2. Implement biologically plausible gradient field superposition
3. Add satiety-based lifecycle modeling for realistic foraging pressure
4. Provide efficient rendering for large environments via viewport system
5. Define meaningful metrics for multi-food foraging performance
6. Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing system

### Non-Goals
1. ~~Multi-agent interactions~~ (future work)
2. ~~Predator-prey dynamics~~ (future work, requires separate spec)
3. ~~Continuous (non-grid) environments~~ (architectural change, separate decision)
4. ~~Food spoilage or decay~~ (adds complexity without clear benefit yet)
5. ~~Variable food quality/nutrition~~ (deferred for simplicity)
6. ~~Traveling salesman optimization~~ (too expensive; using greedy baseline instead)

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Gradient Superposition with Vector Addition
**What:** Compute total gradient at each position as the vector sum of gradients from all active food sources.

**Why:**
- **Biologically accurate**: Real chemotaxis involves overlapping chemical gradients
- **Emergent behavior**: Naturally guides agent to nearest food without explicit nearest-food logic
- **Scalable**: O(n) computation per position where n = number of foods (acceptable for n ≤ 50)
- **Simple implementation**: Leverages existing exponential decay gradient code

**Formula:**
```python
total_gradient_vector = sum(
    food.strength * exp(-distance_to_food / decay_constant) * direction_to_food
    for food in active_foods
)
gradient_magnitude = norm(total_gradient_vector)
gradient_direction = arctan2(total_gradient_vector.y, total_gradient_vector.x)
```

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **Nearest-food only**: Simpler but loses biological realism and creates discontinuities when nearest food changes
- ❌ **Max gradient**: Takes strongest gradient only, not biologically plausible
- ✅ **Vector superposition**: Chosen for biological accuracy and emergent properties

### Decision 2: Immediate Food Respawning with Spatial Constraints
**What:** When food is consumed, immediately spawn a new food source at a location satisfying distance constraints (min distance from agent and other foods).

**Why:**
- **Continuous learning signal**: Ensures agent always has available targets
- **Prevents starvation edge cases**: Eliminates scenario where agent can't reach last distant food
- **Simpler than time-based**: No need to track spawn timers or partial food states
- **Configurable difficulty**: Can be tuned via `max_active_foods` cap

**Algorithm:** Poisson disk sampling with rejection sampling (max 100 attempts)

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **Static all-at-start**: Agent may struggle with final distant foods, poor training signal
- ❌ **Time-based spawning**: Adds state complexity (timers), unclear benefit over immediate
- ✅ **Immediate with constraints**: Chosen for simplicity and continuous training signal

### Decision 3: Satiety as Percentage-Based Restoration
**What:** Satiety restores by a configured percentage of max satiety (default 20%) rather than a fixed amount.

**Why:**
- **Scales with configuration**: Works naturally across small (satiety=200) and large (satiety=800) scenarios
- **Proportional pressure**: Longer episodes require more efficient foraging
- **Easy to reason about**: "Each food restores 20% of hunger" is intuitive
- **Self-balancing**: Harder difficulties (larger grids) naturally get longer satiety pools

**Example:**
- Small config: 200 max satiety → +40 per food → ~5 foods needed to sustain
- Large config: 800 max satiety → +160 per food → ~5 foods needed to sustain (same rate)

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **Fixed restoration amount**: Doesn't scale; needs manual tuning per config
- ❌ **Distance-based restoration**: Complex to implement, unclear advantage
- ✅ **Percentage-based**: Chosen for scalability and simplicity

### Decision 4: Greedy Nearest-Food Baseline for Efficiency Metric
**What:** Measure efficiency relative to Manhattan distance to nearest food at each moment.

**Why:**
- **Computationally tractable**: O(n) per step vs. NP-hard for TSP
- **Biologically plausible**: Real organisms use greedy local search, not global optimization
- **Meaningful comparison**: Shows if agent takes direct paths vs. wandering
- **Real-time computable**: Can track during episode without post-hoc analysis

**Metric:**
```python
# When food becomes implicit target (nearest food changes):
initial_distance = manhattan_distance_to_nearest_food

# When food is collected:
distance_efficiency = (initial_distance - steps_taken) / initial_distance
# Positive = more efficient than random walk
# Negative = took longer than straight path
```

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **TSP optimal**: NP-hard, computationally infeasible for 50+ foods, not biologically relevant
- ❌ **Random walk baseline**: Too weak, doesn't account for gradient guidance
- ✅ **Greedy nearest-food**: Chosen for tractability and biological plausibility

### Decision 5: Viewport Rendering with Odd Dimensions
**What:** Render only an N×N viewport (default 11×11) centered on the agent, with N always odd.

**Why:**
- **Performance**: Rendering 121 cells vs. 10,000 cells (100×100) → 80× reduction
- **Odd dimensions**: Ensures agent is always exactly centered (no off-by-one issues)
- **Consistent UX**: Agent position is visually stable across all steps
- **Logging compromise**: Full environment logged once per session for debugging

**Implementation:**
```python
half_width = viewport_size // 2  # e.g., 11 → 5
view_min_x = max(0, agent_x - half_width)
view_max_x = min(grid_width, agent_x + half_width + 1)
```

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **Always render full grid**: Unusable for 100×100 terminals, poor performance
- ❌ **Even dimensions**: Creates ambiguity about agent centering
- ❌ **Multiple zoom levels**: Over-engineered, adds UI complexity
- ✅ **Fixed odd viewport**: Chosen for simplicity and performance

### Decision 6: Exploration Bonus via Visited Cell Tracking
**What:** Track visited cells in a set; award small bonus (+0.05) on first visit only.

**Why:**
- **Encourages search**: Prevents agents from circling indefinitely in small areas
- **Simple implementation**: O(1) set lookup, negligible memory for 100×100 grid
- **Configurable**: Can disable by setting bonus to 0.0
- **Research option**: Enables comparison to ICM (Intrinsic Curiosity Module) in future work

**Memory cost:** ~10KB for 100×100 grid (10,000 boolean flags)

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **No exploration incentive**: Agents may get stuck in local loops
- ❌ **ICM (neural curiosity)**: Over-complex for initial version, noted for future
- ❌ **Distance-from-start penalty**: Discourages legitimate long-range foraging
- ✅ **Visited cell bonus**: Chosen for simplicity and effectiveness

### Decision 7: BaseEnvironment Refactoring with Inheritance
**What:** Extract common functionality into `BaseEnvironment` abstract class; both `MazeEnvironment` and `DynamicForagingEnvironment` inherit from it.

**Why:**
- **Code reuse**: Gradient computation, movement logic, rendering themes are shared
- **Backward compatibility**: Zero changes to `MazeEnvironment` public API
- **Type safety**: Abstract methods enforce interface consistency
- **Future extensibility**: Easy to add new environment types (predator-prey, multi-agent)

**Shared methods:**
- `move_agent(action)` - Movement validation and execution
- `_compute_gradient(position, goal)` - Single-source gradient calculation
- `render()` framework - Dispatch to theme-specific methods
- `reset()` initialization logic

**Environment-specific methods:**
- `get_state()` - Single goal vs. superposed multi-goal
- `reached_goal()` - Single check vs. any-food check
- `_spawn_food()` - Single fixed location vs. Poisson disk sampling

**Alternatives considered:**
- ❌ **Composition over inheritance**: More verbose, doesn't leverage existing code structure
- ❌ **Completely separate classes**: High code duplication, maintenance burden
- ✅ **Abstract base class**: Chosen for balance of reuse and flexibility

## Performance Analysis

### Memory Complexity
| Component | Memory Cost | Example (100×100, 50 foods) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Food positions | O(f) | 50 × 16 bytes = 800 B |
| Visited cells | O(w × h) | 10,000 × 1 bit = 1.25 KB |
| Gradient cache (if added) | O(w × h × f) | Not implemented (too expensive) |
| **Total overhead** | | **~2 KB** (negligible) |

### Time Complexity (per step)
| Operation | Complexity | Cost (100×100, 50 foods) |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Gradient superposition | O(f) | 50 gradient computations |
| Viewport rendering | O(v²) | 121 cells (11×11) |
| Food spawn (Poisson) | O(f × attempts) | ~50 distance checks |
| Visited cell check | O(1) | Set lookup |
| **Total per step** | O(f + v²) | **~0.5ms** (acceptable) |

### Scalability Limits
- **Tested**: 100×100 grid, 50 foods → <1ms per step
- **Maximum reasonable**: 200×200 grid, 100 foods → ~5ms per step (still interactive)
- **Bottleneck**: Gradient superposition is O(n_foods) per state query

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk 1: Gradient Superposition Ambiguity in Dense Food Clusters
**Risk:** If many foods cluster together, superposed gradient may point "between" them, causing oscillation.

**Mitigation:**
- Poisson disk sampling enforces minimum distance (default 10 cells for large grids)
- Food spawn rejection ensures separation maintained
- If issue persists, can add gradient "sharpening" (power transform)

**Likelihood:** Low (spatial distribution prevents clustering)

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation with Many Foods
**Risk:** O(n_foods) gradient computation may slow down with 100+ simultaneous foods.

**Mitigation:**
- Max foods capped at 50 in preset configs
- Configuration validation warns if >50 foods requested
- Future optimization: spatial hashing for gradient caching (if needed)

**Likelihood:** Low (configs designed to stay within limits)

### Risk 3: Satiety Starvation Before Learning Converges
**Risk:** Agents may starve before learning effective foraging, especially in large environments.

**Mitigation:**
- Preset configs tuned for ~5-10 food collections per episode minimum
- Curriculum learning: start with small config (high satiety/grid ratio)
- Satiety parameters easily tunable per experiment

**Likelihood:** Medium (requires careful config tuning)

### Trade-off 1: Greedy Baseline vs. Optimal Baseline
**Chosen:** Greedy nearest-food baseline
**Sacrificed:** True optimal (TSP) baseline

**Rationale:**
- TSP is NP-hard and computationally infeasible for real-time use
- Greedy baseline is biologically relevant (organisms don't solve TSP)
- Efficiency metric still provides useful signal for path quality

### Trade-off 2: Immediate Respawn vs. Time-Based Spawning
**Chosen:** Immediate food respawn on consumption
**Sacrificed:** Time-based spawning realism

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation (no timer state)
- Continuous training signal (always food available)
- Can simulate time-based by adjusting satiety decay rate
- Easier to reason about for users

### Trade-off 3: Viewport Rendering vs. Full Grid
**Chosen:** Viewport-only rendering (with initial full log)
**Sacrificed:** Continuous visibility of entire environment

**Rationale:**
- Essential for 100×100 grids (unusable otherwise)
- Full environment logged once for debugging
- Users can adjust viewport size if needed
- Performance benefit outweighs visibility loss

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Implementation (This PR)
1. Add `BaseEnvironment` abstract class
2. Refactor `MazeEnvironment` to inherit from base (no API changes)
3. Implement `DynamicForagingEnvironment` with all features
4. Add configuration schemas and validation
5. Create preset configuration files
6. Update metrics and reporting

### Phase 2: Testing and Validation
1. Run full test suite (existing + new tests)
2. Verify backward compatibility with 10+ existing configs
3. Performance benchmarks on all three preset sizes
4. Validate metrics against hand-calculated expectations

### Phase 3: Documentation and Release
1. Update docstrings and type hints
2. Run Ruff and Pyright validation
3. Merge to main branch
4. Archive OpenSpec change

### Rollback Plan
If critical issues found:
1. Feature flag: `enable_dynamic_environments = False` in config
2. All existing configs continue to work (no dynamic mode)
3. Fix issues in separate branch
4. Re-enable once validated

**No data migration needed**: Configurations are stateless, sessions are independent.

## Open Questions

### Q1: Should we add gradient visualization in viewport rendering?
**Status:** Deferred
**Rationale:** Nice-to-have, but adds complexity. Can be added in future PR if users request.

### Q2: Should food have different "sizes" or "nutrition values"?
**Status:** Deferred (out of scope)
**Rationale:** Adds complexity without clear research value yet. Can extend later if experiments show need.

### Q3: Should we support custom food spawn patterns (e.g., clusters, lines)?
**Status:** Deferred
**Rationale:** Poisson disk sampling covers most use cases. Custom patterns can be added later if needed.

### Q4: Should we implement gradient caching for performance?
**Status:** Monitor
**Decision:** Implement only if benchmarks show >10ms per step in realistic scenarios. Current O(n_foods) is acceptable for n ≤ 50.

### Q5: Should satiety be visible to the agent as an observation?
**Status:** Decided - NO (for now)
**Rationale:** Chemotaxis-based navigation doesn't include proprioceptive hunger sensing. Could add as optional feature later for comparison studies.

## Future Extensions (Not in Scope)

1. **Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM)**: Replace simple exploration bonus with learned curiosity
2. **Predator-prey dynamics**: Add predators that reduce satiety on contact
3. **Multi-agent foraging**: Competition for resources
4. **Food decay/spoilage**: Time-limited food availability
5. **Obstacle/wall support**: Navigate around barriers
6. **Continuous (non-grid) environments**: Physics-based movement
7. **Adaptive food spawning**: Difficulty scales with agent performance

These are noted for future specifications but not included in this change to maintain focus and simplicity.
