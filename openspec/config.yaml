  ## Reference
  See AGENTS.md for full project instructions, tech stack, commands, conventions,
  and testing. The information below supplements AGENTS.md with domain-specific
  context for OpenSpec artifact creation.

  ## Purpose
  Quantum Nematode is a research platform simulating a simplified C. elegans
  navigating dynamic foraging environments using quantum variational circuits
  or classical neural networks. Focus areas: quantum ML advantages in foraging,
  biological modeling (chemotaxis, homeostasis), hybrid quantum-classical
  algorithms, and NISQ applications.

  ## Architecture
  - UV workspace: packages/quantum-nematode is the core package
  - 11 pluggable brain architectures in brain/arch/: qvarcircuit, qqlearning,
    qrc, qsnnreinforce, qsnnppo, hybridquantum, hybridclassical, mlpreinforce,
    mlpdqn, mlpppo, spikingreinforce
  - DynamicForagingEnvironment: multi-food foraging with predators and thermotaxis
  - Executor pattern: CPU, GPU, QPU backends
  - YAML-driven simulation configs (configs/examples/)
  - Comprehensive tracking: EpisodeTracker, experiment metadata, CSV/plot exports

  ## Domain Context
  - C. elegans: chemotaxis, thermotaxis, tactile feedback, satiety management
  - Quantum: variational circuits, parameter-shift rule, quantum feature encoding,
    QLIF spiking neurons, surrogate gradients, hybrid quantum-classical training
  - RL: REINFORCE, DQN, experience replay, PPO, reward shaping
  - Spiking networks: LIF neurons, STDP learning, surrogate gradients
  - Grid world: 2D dynamic foraging with viewport-based perception

  ## Constraints
  - IBM Quantum API key required for QPU execution
  - NVIDIA Container Toolkit required for Docker GPU
  - Quantum simulation is memory-intensive for larger circuits
  - Private/research codebase (Do Not Upload classifier)
  - Apache 2.0 license, GitHub: SyntheticBrains/nematode
