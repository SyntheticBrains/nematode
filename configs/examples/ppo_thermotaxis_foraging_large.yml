# PPO with Thermotaxis + Foraging - Large Configuration
# Curriculum level 3: Large-scale foraging with scattered temperature zones
#
# Thermotaxis adds a new sensory modality (AFD neurons) that encodes:
# - Temperature deviation from cultivation temperature (Tc = 20°C)
# - Direction toward warmer temperatures (egocentric)
# - Temperature gradient strength
#
# Large environment (100x100 grid) with moderate temperature challenges:
# - Weak linear gradient (0.1°C/cell) from center
# - 3 hot spots and 3 cold spots with REDUCED intensities
# - Larger decay constant (12) = gentler falloff from spots
# - Central safe zone for spawning (spawn is always comfortable)
#
# Key design principles for learnability:
# - Spots create localized discomfort, not instant death
# - Max temp deviation from spots ~15°C (danger, not lethal)
# - HP damage is survivable - agent can learn to navigate
# - Food healing (10 HP) exceeds danger damage (0.5 HP/step)
#
# Temperature zone layout:
# - Hot zones: right-center (75,50), top-left (25,75), top-right (80,80)
# - Cold zones: bottom-left (25,25), bottom-right (75,25), top-center (50,85)
#
# Success criteria:
# - Collect target foods
# - Learn to avoid/minimize time in discomfort zones
#
# Sensory modules (C. elegans neuron references):
# - food_chemotaxis: Food-specific attraction (AWC, AWA neurons)
# - thermotaxis: Temperature sensing (AFD neurons)
