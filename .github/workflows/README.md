# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and code quality checks.

## Workflows

### `pre-commit.yml`
Runs all pre-commit hooks on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop` branches.

**What it does:**
- ✅ Code formatting with ruff
- ✅ Static type checking with pyright
- ✅ YAML and TOML validation
- ✅ Checks for large files
- ✅ Ensures files end with newline
- ✅ Verifies no uncommitted changes after hooks run

**Note:** Skips the `pytest` hook as tests run in a separate workflow.

---

### `tests.yml`
Runs the full test suite on Python 3.11 and 3.12.

**What it does:**
- ✅ Runs pytest across multiple Python versions (matrix strategy)
- ✅ Uploads coverage reports to Codecov (optional)
- ✅ Runs with verbose output and colored results
- ✅ Uses fail-fast: false to see all Python version results

---

## Running Locally

Before pushing, run pre-commit hooks locally:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run all hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
uv run pytest packages/quantum-nematode/tests/
```

## Workflow Configuration

All workflows use:
- **Python versions**: 3.11, 3.12
- **Package manager**: `uv` with caching enabled
- **Pre-commit**: v3.0.1 action

## Skipping CI

To skip CI on a commit:
```bash
git commit -m "docs: update readme [skip ci]"
```

## Troubleshooting

If pre-commit checks fail:
1. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally
2. Fix any issues reported
3. Commit the changes
4. Push again

If tests fail:
1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Download test artifacts for detailed error information
3. Run tests locally: `uv run pytest packages/quantum-nematode/tests/ -v`
